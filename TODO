Ideas to make the bastion more secure
-------------------------------------

specific selinux policy for the user
- write the policy
- load/apply it

use a separate /tmp

automatically renew the ssh ( add a playbook for that )

make sure the firewall run ?


Features to add
---------------

Permit manual run from user ( sudo ) with git-shell and without, see ansible-rbac, of any playbooks

Verify tasks with ansible-lint before commit in the repo

Add a way to specify the ssh key for git with git-shell (look at freeipa and AuthorizedKeysCommand, or manual)

Playbook for updating ssh keys
- need to have a copy of the old private keys somewhere


Development
-----------

Add a .travis.yml for tasks/main.yml, check python and shell files.
