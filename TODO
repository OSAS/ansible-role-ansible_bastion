Ideas to make the bastion more secure
-------------------------------------

specific selinux policy for the user
- write the policy
- load/apply it

use a separate /tmp

automatically renew the ssh ( add a playbook for that )

make sure the firewall run ?


Features to add
---------------

Permit manual run from user ( sudo )

Support ansible-galaxy update (need to force 1.8)

Verify tasks with ansible-lint before commit in the repo

Make frequency of run configurable

Make the name of the group autorized to commit configurable

Development
-----------

Add some documentation on the architecture

Add a .travis.yml for tasks/main.yml, check python and shell files.
